« We have been devastated to hear that our friend and colleague Eelco Visser (https://eelcovisser.org/) suddenly passed away. Eelco was highly influential in the SLE community, being both a role model and a leader in our community. His many scientific contributions about meta-languages and DSLs has been of high importance in both the scientific and industrial communities, and led to the well known and cutting-edge  language workbench Spoofax. He will be deeply missed by the whole SLE community at large. All our heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends. RIP Eelco. »
