### Virtual SLE 2021

#### SPLASH 2021 and all co-located events (including SLE) will be virtual. The decision to virtualize SPLASH and SLE was made to minimize the risks to attendees due to COVID-19 and associated uncertainties around travel.


### Types of Submissions

SLE accepts three types of papers:

- **Research papers:** These are “traditional” papers detailing research contributions to SLE. These papers have a limit of 12 pages, and may optionally include 8 further pages[*] of bibliography/appendices

- **Tool papers:** These are papers which focus on the tooling aspects which are often forgotten or neglected in research papers. A good tool paper focusses on practical insights that are likely to be useful to other implementers or users in the future. Any of the SLE topics of interest are appropriate areas for tool demonstrations. Submissions must not exceed 5 pages and may optionally include 1 further page of bibliography / appendices. They may optionally come with an appendix with a demo outline / screenshots and/or a short video/screencast illustrating the tool. Tool paper titles must start with "Tool Demo:".

- **New ideas / vision papers:** These are forward-looking papers about ideas that will interest the SLE community but which are not currently at an advanced level of research. These might be about new research avenues or about integrating existing research ideas, or technologies. New ideas / vision papers must not exceed 5 pages,  and may optionally include 1 further page of bibliography / appendices

### Topics of Interest

Broadly speaking, SLE covers software language engineering rather than engineering a specific software language. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Software Language Design and Implementation
	- Approaches to and methods for language design
	- Static semantics (e.g. design rules, well-formedness constraints)
	- Techniques for specifying behavioral / executable semantics
	- Generative approaches (incl. code synthesis, compilation)
	- Meta-languages, meta-tools, language workbenches
- Software Language Validation
	- Verification and formal methods for languages
	- Testing techniques for languages
	- Simulation techniques for languages
- Software Language Integration and Composition
	- Coordination of heterogeneous languages and tools
	- Mappings between languages (incl. transformation languages)
	- Traceability between languages
	- Deployment of languages to different platforms
- Software Language Maintenance
	- Software language reuse
	- Language evolution
	- Language families and variability
- Domain-specific approaches for any aspects of SLE (design, implementation, validation, maintenance)
- Empirical evaluation and experience reports of language engineering tools
	- User studies evaluating usability
	- Performance benchmarks
	- Industrial applications

**Workshops:** Workshops will be organized by SPLASH. Please inform us and contact the SPLASH organizers if you would like to organize a workshop of interest to the SLE audience. Information on how to submit workshops can be found at the SPLASH 2021 Website.

### Artifact Evaluation

For the fifth year SLE will use an evaluation process for assessing the quality of the artifacts on which papers are based to foster the culture of experimental reproducibility. Authors of accepted papers are invited to submit artifacts. For more information, please have a look at the [Artifact Evaluation](http://www.sleconf.org/2021/ArtifactEvaluation.html) page.

### Submission

#### Format

Submissions have to use the [ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format "acmart"](http://sigplan.org/Resources/Author/#acmart-format); please make sure that you always use the latest [ACM SIGPLAN acmart LaTeX template](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-master.zip), and that the document class definition is `\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}`. Do not make any changes to this format!

Ensure that your submission is legible when printed on a black and white printer. In particular, please check that colors remain distinct and font sizes in figures and tables are legible.

To increase fairness in reviewing, a double-blind review process has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences. In this line, SLE will follow the double-blind process. Author names and institutions should be omitted from submitted papers, and references to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person. No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer their identities in implicit ways.

All submissions must be in PDF format.

#### Concurrent Submissions

Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as described by [SIGPLAN’s Republication Policy](http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication). Submitters should also be aware of [ACM’s Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism](http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism_policy). Submissions that violate these policies will be desk-rejected.

### Reviewing Process

All submitted papers will be reviewed by at least three members of the program committee. Research papers and tool papers will be evaluated concerning novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call. New ideas / vision papers will be evaluated primarily concerning novelty, significance, readability, and alignment with the conference call.

For fairness reasons, all submitted papers must conform to the above instructions. Submissions that violate these instructions may be rejected without review, at the discretion of the PC chairs.

### Awards

- **Distinguished paper:** Award for most notable paper, as determined by the PC chairs based on the recommendations of the programme committee.
- **Distinguished reviewer:** Award for distinguished reviewer, as determined by the PC chairs.
- **Distinguished artifact:** Award for the artifact most significantly exceeding expectations, as determined by the AEC chairs based on the recommendations of the artifact evaluation committee.

### Publication

All accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library.

**AUTHORS TAKE NOTE:** The official publication date is the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Digital Library. This date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of the conference. The official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings related to published work.

### Contact

For additional information, clarification, or answers to questions, please contact the Programme Chairs by email.
